# Bob - A game about my dog

I have a dream and it involves creating a game about my dog. So I've started to work towards this goal and just build stuff. Also I'm keeping a blog of everything I do to realize my dream, you can find it here: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/bobandthesearchforhappiness

## Dependecies ##

- Node
- NPM
- JSPM (install by using `npm install jspm -g`


## Installation ##

Just run `npm install` to install the npm dependencies, then run `jspm install` and run `npm start` to start the server and load the game in the browser.

## Boilerplate ##

I've downloaded a boilerplate for the initial setup, created by Michael Grenon (@nsipid) and Ashley Grenon (@townsean), you can find it here: https://github.com/thecodingcouple/phaser-es2015.

## Placeholder graphics ##

I've used some placeholder graphics to speed up the development. They can be found here:

In a later stage I'll replace the images with my own art :)
