# Bob - A game about my dog

I have a dream and it involves creating a game about my dog. So I've started to work towards this goal and just build stuff. Also I'm keeping a blog of everything I do to realize my dream, you can find it here: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/bobandthesearchforhappiness

## Dependecies ##

- Node
- NPM

## Installation ##

Just run `npm install` to install the dependencies and run `gulp` to start the server.

## Boilerplate ##

I've downloaded a boilerplate for the initial setup, created by Daniel Belohlavek (https://twitter.com/dbhvk), you can find it here: https://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate

## Placeholder graphics ##

I've used some placeholder graphics to speed up the development. They can be found here:

In a later stage I'll replace the images with my own art :)
